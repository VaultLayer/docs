VaultLayer is the simplest, self-custodial way to grow your BTC on Layer 1 and unlock DeFi opportunities across EVM chains.

Our protocol turns Bitcoin into a productive asset — without sacrificing custody — by wrapping it in Smart Vaults that enable:

* ✅ Bitcoin staking with full ownership
* 💰 Yield optimization using CoreDAO’s dual-staking rewards
* 🔓 Cross-chain liquidity via P2P lending markets
* 🤖 Automation with permissioned Vaulter AI agent
