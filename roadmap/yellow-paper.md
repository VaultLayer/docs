## Abstract

Vaulter Agents provide secure, programmable delegation for NFT-owned Smart Vaults (Bitcoin + EVM). Threshold ECDSA via Lit Protocol enforces non‑custodial control, while on‑chain policy contracts constrain agent actions. Agents, built on ElizaOS, execute cross‑chain DeFi strategies like BTC liquid staking, Smart DCA, and stablecoin yield under cryptographic guardrails.
