# ASX Staking Strategy

## Overview

The ASX Staking Strategy automatically stakes ASX tokens when your balance exceeds the trigger threshold. This strategy ensures your ASX tokens are always working to earn staking rewards by automatically staking any available ASX tokens.

## How It Works

### Core Algorithm

1. **Balance Assessment**: Analyzes current ASX holdings (staked + unstaked)
2. **Reward Monitoring**: Checks for pending ASX rewards (for reporting)
3. **Staking Optimization**: Stakes unstaked tokens when balance exceeds minimum
4. **Portfolio Update**: Records staking transactions and updates portfolio value
5. **Performance Tracking**: Monitors staking efficiency and gas costs

### Staking Logic

#### **Minimum Stake Threshold**
- **Requirement**: Minimum 1.00 ASX to stake
- **Purpose**: Ensures gas costs are justified by staking rewards
- **Optimization**: Balances staking frequency with gas efficiency

#### **Reward Monitoring**
- **Purpose**: Tracks pending rewards for reporting
- **Frequency**: Monitors rewards whenever strategy executes
- **Reporting**: Shows pending rewards in execution summary

## Configuration Parameters

### Required Settings
- **Trigger Amount**: Minimum ASX balance to trigger staking (e.g., 1.0 ASX)
- **Trigger Chain**: Blockchain network for ASX operations
- **Minimum Stake Amount**: Minimum tokens required for staking (default: 1.00 ASX)

### Optional Settings
- **Allowed Chains**: Specific chains for execution
- **Custom Prompt**: Additional strategy instructions

## Execution Flow

```
1. Check ASX Balance (Staked + Unstaked)
   ↓
2. Check Pending Rewards (for reporting)
   ↓
3. Stake Unstaked Tokens (if > minimum)
   ↓
4. Record Transactions & Update Portfolio
```

## Example Execution

### Input
- **Staked Balance**: 50 ASX
- **Unstaked Balance**: 2.5 ASX
- **Pending Rewards**: 0.8 ASX
- **Trigger Amount**: 1.0 ASX

### Execution
1. **Stake Tokens**: 2.5 ASX staked (unstaked balance)
2. **Result**: Total staked balance increased to 52.5 ASX
3. **Pending Rewards**: 0.8 ASX remain unclaimed

## Benefits

### **Automated Staking**
- No manual staking required
- Continuous token staking as they become available
- Automatic yield generation

### **Gas Optimization**
- Batches operations to minimize gas costs
- Only stakes when amounts justify gas expenses
- Efficient staking execution

### **Portfolio Growth**
- Maximizes ASX token utility
- Continuous staking for yield generation
- Passive income accumulation

### **Risk Management**
- Minimum thresholds prevent excessive gas spending
- Automatic error handling and recovery
- Transaction monitoring and reporting

## Risk Considerations

### **Smart Contract Risk**
- ASX staking contract security
- Potential bugs or vulnerabilities
- Protocol upgrade risks

### **Market Risk**
- ASX token price volatility
- Staking reward rate changes
- Protocol parameter adjustments

### **Technical Risk**
- Network congestion affecting gas costs
- Transaction failures or reversals
- Smart contract interaction errors

### **Liquidity Risk**
- Staking lock-up periods
- Unstaking delays
- Emergency withdrawal limitations
- No automatic reward claiming (manual claiming required)

## Performance Metrics

### **Tracking Metrics**
- Total ASX staked
- Pending rewards accumulated (for monitoring)
- Staking APY and returns
- Gas costs per operation
- Transaction success rate

### **Optimization Opportunities**
- Adjust minimum stake amounts based on gas costs
- Optimize staking frequency
- Monitor staking rates and reward accumulation

## Best Practices

### **Setting Trigger Amounts**
- Consider gas costs vs. staking rewards
- Account for network congestion
- Balance frequency with efficiency

### **Monitoring Performance**
- Track staking APY over time
- Monitor gas costs per operation
- Track reward accumulation for manual claiming
- Compare with alternative yield strategies

### **Risk Management**
- Diversify across multiple staking protocols
- Monitor protocol health and updates
- Maintain emergency unstaking capability

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Strategy Not Executing**
- Check ASX balance on specified chain
- Verify minimum stake requirements
- Ensure strategy is active

**High Gas Costs**
- Increase minimum stake amounts
- Optimize execution timing
- Consider Layer 2 solutions

**Staking Failures**
- Check contract permissions
- Verify sufficient gas limits
- Monitor network conditions

**Reward Accumulation**
- Monitor pending rewards for manual claiming
- Check reward eligibility
- Monitor contract state

## Advanced Features

### **Multi-Chain Support**
- Execute across multiple networks
- Optimize for best staking rates
- Diversify protocol risk

### **Portfolio Integration**
- Automatic position tracking
- Performance analytics
- Integration with other strategies

### **Customization Options**
- Adjustable minimum thresholds
- Custom staking parameters
- Flexible execution timing

## Staking Mechanics

### **How ASX Staking Works**
- **Lock-up Period**: Tokens are locked for staking duration
- **Reward Distribution**: Rewards distributed based on staked amount
- **Reward Accumulation**: Rewards accumulate until manually claimed
- **Unstaking**: Tokens can be unstaked after lock-up period

### **Reward Calculation**
- **APY**: Annual Percentage Yield on staked tokens
- **Reward Rate**: Daily/weekly reward distribution
- **Accumulation**: Rewards accumulate until manually claimed

### **Gas Cost Considerations**
- **Staking Gas**: Cost to stake tokens
- **Unstaking Gas**: Cost to unstake tokens
- **Optimization**: Batch operations to minimize costs

## Protocol Integration

### **Supported Protocols**
- ASX staking contracts
- Reward distribution systems
- Governance participation

### **Security Features**
- Multi-signature requirements
- Time-lock mechanisms
- Emergency pause functionality
