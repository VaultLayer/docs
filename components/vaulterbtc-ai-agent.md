# 🤖 VaulterBTC AI Agent

### What is Vaulter?

**VaultLayer is building Vaulter BTC:**\
The 🏁 **first AI Agent that grows your Bitcoin while you sleep** — using delegated Smart Vaults with verifiable on-chain policies.

Vaulter is built for secure, programmable automation of your staking, swapping, and bridging strategies.

* ✅ **Secure**: Operates only with your Smart Vault’s on-chain permissions.
* 🔄 **Automated**: Executes yield strategies daily.
* 🧠 **AI-First**: Built on the [ElizaOS](https://github.com/elizaos) Agent Framework.
* 📬 **User-Friendly**: Sends Telegram updates about what’s happening.
* 🟠 **Bitcoin Native**: Designed around BTC staked on CoreDAO.

**Vaulter** is your Bitcoin-native automation agent.\
It securely executes predefined strategies like:

1. 🧲 **Claiming CoreDAO Bitcoin staking rewards** (`vltCORE`)
2. 📈 **Buying more BTC** through DCA-style triggers

More strategies and tools will be added over time. You’ll shape Vaulter’s behavior with prompts and triggers.

## ⚠️ Why We Built It

Today’s AI DeFi alternatives come with risks:

* 🤯 AI hallucinations
* 🧑‍💻 Developer rugpulls
* ❌ 1-wallet-per-agent models don’t scale

### 🔐 So how do we safely trust an AI Agent to automate our Bitcoin DeFi?

We solved this by introducing:

> **Delegated Smart Vaults with on-chain, enforceable policies.**

## 🧠 What is a Smart Vault?

A **Smart Vault** is a programmable, decentralized wallet—built to be:

* 🔑 **Decentralized**: Powered by Lit Protocol’s Key Network
* 💧 **Liquid**: Tradable as NFTs on EVM L2 markets
* 🧠 **AI-First**: Designed for delegated strategies like staking, swapping, or lending

## 🛠️ How It Works

When you delegate a Smart Vault to Vaulter:

1. You define a **VlStrategy** policy (strategy type, trigger, optional prompt).
2. Vaulter reads your policy and tracks execution conditions.
3. Once triggered, it:
   * 🧠 Evaluates allowed tools & market data
   * ✅ Enforces policy constraints (chain, contract, functions, limits)
   * 🔁 Executes your strategy via secure onchain tools
4. 💬 Sends you a Telegram update with results

All execution is **asynchronous and automated**.

## 💡 Modular & Evolving

The agent is built using [ElizaOS](https://github.com/elizaos), enabling:

* 🧩 Modular strategy plugins
* 🗣️ Custom prompts that shape behavior
* 🛡️ Strong policy enforcement to prevent abuse
* 🔄 Ongoing updates with new tools and integrations

You’re in control. We’ll keep adding more options—so you can tell Vaulter **exactly how to grow your Bitcoin**.
