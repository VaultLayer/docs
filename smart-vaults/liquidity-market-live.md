# ü§ù P2P Liquidity

**CORE (vltCORE)**

* Stake BTC and use it as collateral.
* Earn more for CORE staking and get BTC on discount.

#### Other EVM L2s (USDC)

* Get exposure to BTC staked on L1 and use it as collateral.
* Get access to discounted BTC via P2P.

The P2P Liquidity market allows Smart Vault NFT holders with L1-staked Bitcoin, CORE, ETH, AVAX, BNB or USDC, to get access to liquidity without having to sell.

Users in need of liquidity make a loan request instead, using their Smart Vault NFT as collateral, set their terms (amount, APR and maturity time), and lenders bid using a reverse auction approach.

The lender with the best bid, provides liquidity and earns yield or the NFT collateral in case of default.

:warning: Loan requests are P2P (Peer-To-Peer) and OTC (Over The Counter). Do Your Own Research (DYOR) both before requesting a loan (borrowers) or providing liquidity (lenders). NFT Collections' floor price are shown for information purposes. As a best practice, loans should be overcollateralized, meaning the value of the underlying asset (the NFT) should be bigger than the loan amount being requested.

* [Lend $CORE (provide liquidity for NFT collateral)](../points/lend-usdcore.md)
