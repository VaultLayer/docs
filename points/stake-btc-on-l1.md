:warning: If you use Unisat, make sure you use a taproot (bc1p) address.

Click on Portfolio:

Check your NFT Vaults list and click on the **>** icon to enter into it:

Nex, let's login into the selected NFT vault.

&#x20;You will need to sign Unisat’s or your preferred Ethereum wallet' request to confirm you own the NFT Vault you are trying to log into :writing\_hand:

:warning: To start staking, you will need to transfer testnet BTC to your NFT Vault staking address. You can use any BTC faucet ([here is one](https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/send.php)), or ask in our [Telegram group](https://t.me/+Q58TzLXmvGM0MGFh) (provide your NFT Vault Bitcoin address and we will send some your way).

Now that you have testnet BTC in your NFT Vault staking address, let’s stake some in @Coredao\_Org!

Click on “Stake BTC”!

Select BTC from the upper-right dropdown menu, the amount to stake, the time and a Network Fee, and click on “**Stake**”! You will be asked to sign the staking transaction with the Vault:

If all went out smoothly, you will get a “SUCCESS Tx” with the transaction ID at the top.

Congratulations! You completed your first staking task to earn LASER points!
