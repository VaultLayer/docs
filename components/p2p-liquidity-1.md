# ü§ù P2P Liquidity

VaultLayer‚Äôs **P2P NFT Lending Market** allows users to unlock liquidity using staked Bitcoin or eligible NFTs as collateral ‚Äî without selling the underlying asset. The system operates trustlessly across multiple EVM chains, creating a decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace for loans.

***

## üåâ Multi-Chain Liquidity

VaultLayer has deployed the P2P Lending Market across multiple chains to enable cross-chain liquidity against staked BTC:

<table><thead><tr><th width="160.89605712890625">Chain</th><th width="160.84417724609375">Loan Token</th><th>Use Case</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CoreDAO</td><td>vltCORE</td><td>Stake BTC, borrow CORE using Vault NFT</td></tr><tr><td>Arbitrum</td><td>USDC</td><td>Access discounted BTC via lending markets</td></tr><tr><td>BSC</td><td>USDC</td><td>Institutional lending exposure to BTC staking</td></tr><tr><td>Avalanche</td><td>USDC</td><td>Bid on loans backed by staked BTC</td></tr><tr><td>Optimism</td><td>USDC</td><td>Get yield on BTC-backed NFT loans</td></tr><tr><td>Base</td><td>USDC</td><td>OTC loans for LSV holders</td></tr></tbody></table>

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Borrowers lock eligible NFTs ‚Äî like **Liquid Smart Vaults** or **CoreDAO NFTs (e.g., Coretoshi, Core Origin)** ‚Äî as collateral and define loan terms:

* **Loan amount**
* **APR**
* **Maturity time**

Lenders bid using a **reverse auction** approach. The best bid (lowest interest rate) wins, providing liquidity in either $CORE or $USDC depending on the chain. If the borrower defaults, the lender claims the NFT.

> üîÑ Loans are **OTC**. Floor prices are **informational only** ‚Äî **DYOR** is essential for both borrowers and lenders.

***

:warning: Loan requests are OTC (Over The Counter). Do Your Own Research (DYOR) both before requesting a loan (borrowers) or providing liquidity (lenders). NFT Collections' floor price are shown for information purposes. As a best practice, loans should be overcollateralized, meaning the value of the underlying asset (the NFT) should be bigger than the loan amount being requested.

P2P Liquidity is a foundational piece of VaultLayer‚Äôs broader vision:
