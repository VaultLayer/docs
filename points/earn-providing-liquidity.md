Click on **Liquidity Market**:

Scroll down and select any of the **Active Loans** to place your bid (1% below the asking rate by default).

Check the confirmation pop-up and confirm the bid, loan amount and interest rate and click **OK**.

Then **Confirm** the**Transaction** request in your wallet.

If all went out smoothly, you should get a SUCCESS txId:

At this point the selected borrower will see your bid and can accept it at any time.

Meanwhile it will show in **Pending** status:

:warning: You can also cancel your bid from here at any time, as long as it has not been accepted by a borrower.

After the loan is accepted, its **Status** will switch to **Accepted** in the **Liquidity Market** section:

After a borrower has repaid the loan request, you will see the principal plus interest beneath the "**Pending To Withdraw**" section.

Click on **Withdraw**:

After clicking Confirm on the transaction, you will get a message confirming your funds have been transferred back to your wallet address:
