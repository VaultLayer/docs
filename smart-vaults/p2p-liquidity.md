# ü§ù P2P Liquidity

The NFT lending market allows Core DAO NFT holders to get access to liquidity without having to sell their NFT.

:information\_source: Supported collections: Coretoshi and Core Origin.

Users in need of liquidity make a loan request instead, using their Core DAO NFT as collateral, set their terms (amount, APR and maturity time), and lenders bid using a reverse auction approach.

The lender with the best bid, provides liquidity and earns yield or the NFT collateral in case of default.

:warning: Loan requests are OTC (Over The Counter). Do Your Own Research (DYOR) both before requesting a loan (borrowers) or providing liquidity (lenders). NFT Collections' floor price are shown for information purposes. As a best practice, loans should be overcollateralized, meaning the value of the underlying asset (the NFT) should be bigger than the loan amount being requested.

:information\_source: Fees: Flat platform fee of 2% flat for all actions taken in the market: Loan request, bid, bid acceptance, repayment, withdraw, loan cancellation and bid cancellation.
