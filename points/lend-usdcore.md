# Earn Providing Liquidity

🔗 **Getting Started:**

* Connect to https://beta.vaultlayer.xyz/ using your Ethereum wallet with a Core DAO address (EVM/0x format)
* Select "Ethereum Wallet" and connect with your preferred Core DAO wallet

💰 **Making a Loan Bid:**

* Navigate to the Liquidity Market section
* Browse Active Loans and select one to bid on (default bid is 1% below the asking rate)
* Review and confirm the bid details including loan amount and interest rate
* Approve the transaction in your wallet

⏳ **Managing Your Bid:**

* Successfully submitted bids receive a transaction ID confirmation
* Your bid appears in "Pending" status while waiting for borrower acceptance
* You can cancel pending bids anytime before they're accepted

✅ **After Loan Acceptance:**

* Status changes to "Accepted" once a borrower takes your loan
* When the borrower repays, your principal plus interest appears under "Pending To Withdraw"
* Click "Withdraw" and confirm the transaction to transfer funds back to your wallet

🏦 The process allows lenders to bid on loans at competitive rates while maintaining control over their pending offers until accepted by borrowers.
